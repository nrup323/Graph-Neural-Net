# Graph-Neural-Net
This repository contains the all the projects where I use Graph Neural Network to Solve the Problems.


## 1) [Classifications of Research Publications using Graph Neural Network.](https://github.com/nrup323/Graph-Neural-Net/blob/main/Node%20Classifications%20GNN.ipynb)

This notebook describes the two methods to classsify the research publications.
  1) An MLP Model(Acc: 55%)
  2) A Graph Neural Network.(Acc 81%)
  Main task of this projects is to just demonstrate that if the relations information among the nodes of the dataset is given Graph NN can be used to leverage those for accurate predictions.
  
  The model is built using Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric.
  The models was tested on Cora Dataset, link can be found [here](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA).
